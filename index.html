    <h1>Privacy Policy for Webpage Archiver: Data Collection for AI Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 31, 2025</p>

    <p>This privacy policy explains how [Your Name or Company Name] ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with our Chrome extension, "Webpage Archiver: Data Collection for AI Service" (the "Extension").</p>

    <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. The fundamental principle of our Extension is that **your data is your own.** Our Extension is designed to work entirely on your local machine.</p>

    <h2>Information We Process</h2>
    <p>The Extension processes information only when you explicitly activate it by clicking its icon on a webpage. The information processed includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Webpage Content:</strong> The full HTML source code and the content of linked CSS files of the active tab.</li>
        <li><strong>Webpage Metadata:</strong> The URL and Title of the active tab.</li>
        <li><strong>Browser Information:</strong> Your browser's User-Agent string.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>The sole purpose of processing this information is to fulfill the core function of the Extension, which is to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Generate complete, self-contained HTML snapshot files of the webpage for data collection.</li>
        <li>Create a text-based log file containing the Webpage Metadata and Browser Information for your reference and record-keeping.</li>
        <li>Save these generated files directly to your local computer using the browser's standard download functionality, suitable for building datasets for AI services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage, Sharing, and Transmission</h2>
    <p><strong>This is the most important section of our policy:</strong></p>
    <p>The "Webpage Archiver: Data Collection for AI Service" Extension **does not store, save, or transmit your data to any external server or third party.** All processing happens locally within your browser on your computer. The generated files are downloaded directly to your personal download folder.</p>
    <p>We do not have access to your data at any point. We do not collect any analytics, telemetry, or user activity information.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
